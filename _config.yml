# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This repo aims to centralize content (HOW-TOs, scripts, slides, events etc) curated by Docker User Groups. The main objective is to help members of the Docker community who share similar interests to learn from & collaborate with each other during events. This is a community oriented and run repository, which is maintained by Docker community members. This is the perfect place to host projects, proofs of concept, documentation, and more…
