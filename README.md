# Docker Community Repository

Welcome to the Docker Community repo! This repo aims to centralize content (HOW-TOs, scripts, slides, events etc) curated by Docker Captains, Docker Community Leaders. The main objective is to help members of the Docker community who share similar interests to learn from & collaborate with each other during events. 

This is a community oriented and run repository, which is maintained by Docker community members. This is the perfect place to host projects, proofs of concept, documentation, and more...

# Mission and Vision

# Scope

# Enroll

# Slack

Please help by joining the Slack channel (we like to talk about Docker in general, even if you only have questions — discussion helps the community and guides improvements) and contributing to the guide. This guide is open to contributions, so unlike a blog, it can keep improving. Like any open source effort, we combine efforts but also review to ensure high quality.
