### #2 Post-event Review

- Sit down with your team for a debrief session where you discuss how the event went. 
- Consider inviting at least some of the volunteers. 
- First, these volunteers are bound to have valuable input. 
- Second, you’ll likely want to ask them for help in the future.
- The main purpose of this meeting is to talk about how things went and what could be improved. 
- Your three main goals are to:
- Evaluate whether the event was a success according to whatever goals you’ve set.
- Have an open discussion about what worked well and what could be done better the next time around. 
- If things worked - why did they work and what made them a success? 
- If something failed - what was the main reason behind that and how can it be fixed? What would you have done differently if you had the chance?
- Leave everyone full of ideas and pumped for your next event.


### #3 Ask for feedback

- While the event is still fresh in everyone’s mind, get their feedback about it. 
- Even if you don’t intend to organise similar events in the near future, knowing exactly what your guests and participants think will let you better evaluate whether it succeeded. 
- Don’t be afraid of asking, by the way. 
- Most attendees will be more than thrilled give their feedback and input. 
- After all, they’d like to attend better events, so why not help you improve the ones you organise?
- Be straightforward. Collect input is to send out an email link to a survey that people can fill out online.
- Pick the one you like. If you can, add an incentive (free tickets to your next events, chance to win a gift card, and the like.).
- Having everyone fill out the same survey makes it easy to compare their input and spot trends and areas that need improvement. 
- Your questions can include a rating of different aspects of the event, so you can even quantify these.
- You may also consider getting feedback from your sponsors and speakers in a similar manner, especially if they’re likely to be a part of your future events.

### #4  Follow up on social media

- Online chatter about your event won’t immediately quiet down after the event is over. 
- People will be discussing the event and sharing their impressions for days to come. 
- If you’ve encouraged people to ask questions and participate using your hashtags during the event, take some time to check the hashtag and discover what’s being discussed and shared.
- Follow the conversation and jump in where it make sense to chip in with your input, thank the guests, or answer questions. 
- If you have a social media competition going, make sure to pick winners and distribute prizes as promised. 
- If you notice some especially positive feedback, reach out to these guests to request a more formal testimonial or endorsement. 
- These could be a great marketing tool for future events, as they come from real people who’ve experienced the event for themselves.
- Engaging in post-event social media chatter and keeping the buzz going will also help you build audience for your next event. 
- Not to mention that it could be an invaluable source of marketing material - real-life photos, videos, and even catchy phrases that people use to describe your event.

### #5  Collect marketing & media material

-  Share the most flattering photos and videos on your social media profiles and official event websites or pages. 
- Attendees tend to enjoy finding themselves in the pictures and videos, so it’s a great way to generate more buzz.

### #6 Create a highlight reel

- Having a ton of material is only the first step. 
- To turn it into an effective marketing tool, you’ll want to sift through the raw footage to pick out the best photos, videos, and other highlights of the event.
- Hire a professional to spend a week or so after the event going through everything you’ve collected and putting together a highlight reel that showcases the event’s best moments.
- While it takes time and skill to turn a mishmash of photos and videos into a coherent piece that captures the event’s highlights, it’ll prove invaluable in promoting future events.

### #7 Start planning your next event

- Start putting all of that to good use and begin jotting down ideas for your next fantastic event. 
- You can fix what was broken, do more of what worked well, finetune your promotional efforts, and try out new things.
