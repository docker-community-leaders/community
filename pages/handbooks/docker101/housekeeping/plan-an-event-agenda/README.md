# Plan for an Event 

- Your event must be posted on your [city’s Chapter page](https://events.docker.com/chapters/)
- Try to create event 1 month before the event
- If you are unsure of how to use your chapter page [please watch this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ld54sqzTTBMiygUzsjRD7B10XzWozbMl/view?usp=sharing)
- If you are having issues with your page, do not have a page or need admin permissions please contact William over Docker community Slack or send email to william.quiviger(AT)docker.com
